# Mitigate-a-Malware-Attack
Using Python to write a firewall rule to technically mitigate a malware from spreading.
# Context for this project
Implement a firewall rule using the Python scripting language. Python is a common scripting language used across both offensive and defensive information security tasks.
In this task, we will simulate the firewallâ€™s scripting language by using an HTTP Server. You can assume this HTTP Server has no computational requirements and has the sole purpose of filtering incoming traffic.
# The malware attack
This attack script (reference the file exp.py in Resources) exploits a vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the server (reference the file firewall_server), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
# How to mitigate this malware attack
To mitigate this attack, we can add a firewall rule to block requests containing suspicious patterns indicative of this exploit.
- Add a firewall rule to inspect incoming requests and block any that contain the specific pattern used in the attack.
- In Resources, you will find a test script that you can use to simulate the malicious requests to the server and validate the firewall rule's effectiveness.
  
**Setting Up and Testing the Web Server**
1. Open command prompt in the directory containing the scripts
2. Run the web server script: python firewall_server.py

**Executing the Malware Script to Test Firewall Rules**
1. Open another command prompt window in the directory containing the scripts
2. Run the malware script: python test_request.py
